<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Zack Njamba a passionate Web Developer who loves turning ideas into clean, functional, and visually engaging digital experiences. I specialize in crafting responsive, user-centered websites and web applications that bring real value to clients and users alike.</p>

<p>With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Node.js, I’m always exploring new technologies to improve performance, scalability, and design. Whether it’s building from scratch or optimizing an existing project, I’m driven by the challenge of writing elegant code and solving complex problems creatively.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me learning new tools, experimenting with UI/UX design trends, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe great development is not just about code it’s about understanding people, purpose, and the story behind every project..</p>
